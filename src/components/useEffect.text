//UseState
useState returns an array with exactly two elements. The first returned element will always be the current state, while the second returned element is always a function that allows us to update the state, react is aware of it and will re-render the component 



Using react useEffect is like using componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate in one effect.
For componentDidMount we will use useEffect with an empty array.
